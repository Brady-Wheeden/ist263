    My name is Brady Wheeden, I am a Health and Exercise Science Major. I chose Exercise Science because I am very passionate about discovering the human body and its physical capabilities. I few accomplishments of mine are running a marathon, speaking at rare disease conventions, participating in multiple clinical research trials, and creating a Instagram page for kids struggling with the rare disease EPP. Outside of school I love to work out every day, I love to run, my favorite book is “Cant Hurt Me” by David Goggins, and my favorite movie is “Good Fellas”.
