    <h2>Personal Info</h2>

    <p>My name is Brady Wheeden, I am a <strong>Health and Exercise Science Major</strong>. I chose Exercise Science because I am very passionate about discovering the human body and its physical capabilities. I few accomplishments of mine are running a marathon, speaking at rare disease conventions, participating in multiple clinical research trials, and creating a Instagram page for kids struggling with the rare disease EPP. Outside of school I love to work out every day, I love to run, my favorite book is “Cant Hurt Me” by David Goggins, and my favorite movie is “Good Fellas”.</p>
